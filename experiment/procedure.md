## Procedure

Estimating a project cost is a deep science and need to be mastered differently. It needs experience working in different projects and the impact of the activity is vital on any project. Here are few steps to carry out for estimation. We expect you to refer to catalogues of various manufacturer and arrive at competitive cost else your estimation will be highest and you may lose the project. This exercise will help you to connect with many manufacturer and get a chance to know features of their products.   

#### Start the Simulation
-	Click on the "Start" button.
-	Enter instrument name-wise details including:
1.	Name, Make and Model (Be realistic)
1.	Base price
1.	Quantity
1.	Calculate all data for first four instruments for P&F, Insurance, and freight

-	The system will then calculate:
1.	Packing and Forwarding (2%)
1.	Insurance (0.5%)
1.	Freight (1%)
1.	Total cost

#### Add Instruments
-	Click on "Add Row" to add new instruments. The addition of instruments must be based on the requirement for the plant you are preparing estimation
-	Enter the required details and check the values

#### Get Results
-	Click on "Result" to view the final cost estimation
-	If your cost estimation is either lower or upper than our estimated cost it will be informed
